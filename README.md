# Rave-Reviews

## Description

Rave Review is a website designed with time efficiency in mind. It is not unusual for someone to plan a trip to a city and want to experience the best that, that city has to offer. The process of planning that trip can often be time-consuming and frustrating at the same time. This is the reason our team decided to create Rave Review.

Rave Review was motivated with our users in mind. We believe planning a vacation, a weekend trip or simply just an outing should be quick and easy. Our page is a one-stop shop for planning trips or events by focusing on time efficiency. Simply enter the city and the date and we will take care of the rest. Hotels, Restaurants, Bars and local attractions, are all just one click away!
